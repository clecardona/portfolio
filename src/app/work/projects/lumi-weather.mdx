A cross-platform weather App that provides real-time weather information and forecasts.

## The context

I wanted to create a weather station at home in order to display weather forecast before going out.
I had this unused android smartphone on the bottom of a drawer, so I decided to make a use of it.
Quickly I realized that there were no good looking Android apps that would work on landscape mode.
I thought I would be a good simple use case to start with developing my first App.

Built with modern web technologies, it runs on web browsers, Android, and iOS devices.<br/>
The first outcast of the project has been made using Claude AI. (3.5 Sonnet)

## The outcome

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    width: "100%",
    justifyContent: "center",
    gap: 50,
  }}
>
